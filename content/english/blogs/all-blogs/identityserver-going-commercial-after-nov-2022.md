IdentityServer4.0 is an open-source SSO software based on OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. This free tool is written in the .NET framework (4.5.x) and .NET Core to provide single sign-on services across multiple applications. As an authentication server, it provides a JWT token that can be used to access digital resources. It offers many provisions such as access control for API, user interface customizations, API authorization, and claim-based providers. Further, it is flexible, extensible, and comes with self-hosting capabilities. In addition, it supports multiple flows and federated identities such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks.

IdentityServer4.0 is best known for ASP.NET projects for implementing OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.
